# MedLineBling
I know when that MedLine Bling, that can only mean one thing...  
<br>
A HackDuke 2015 project spawned in the final 2 hours of the hackathon after many fruitless efforts 
to get some National Library of Medicine (NLM) API's to work. <br>

MedLineBling is a web application for people who have medications but have forgotten what exactly the medications do (a surprising number of prescription drugs don't list the 
purpose/effects of the drug on the label). <br>

It allows users to query an NLM database for a description of what their medication does 
and for other medications with the same active ingredient in case they're looking for an alternative/generics 
(should consult a physician before actually making any kind of switch though).
